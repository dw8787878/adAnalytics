# adAnalytics

Just trying out some JS & JQuery exerices to analyze ad view data.  <br />

inview_percent - Calculate % of ad in viewport. <br />
inview_1 - When 50% of the ad in viewport is showing, start timer.<br />
inview_2 - Same as inview_1, and when the browser tab is highlighted.<br />
adfinding_1 - Find the targeted ad.<br />
adfinding_2 - If targeted ad is clicked, calculate new % of ad in viewport.  Top or bottom of ad may be outside viewport. <br />
