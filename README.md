# adAnalytics

Just trying out some JS & JQuery exerices to analyze ad view data.  

inview_percent - Calculate % of ad in viewport.
inview_1 - When 50% of the ad in viewport is showing, start timer.
inview_2 - Same as inview_1, and when the browser tab is highlighted.
adfinding_1 - Find the targeted ad.
adfinding_2 - If targeted ad is clicked, calculate new % of ad in viewport.  Top or bottom of ad may be outside viewport.
